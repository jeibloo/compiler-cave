  * For my first foray into the abyss I've chosen the Kaleidoscope toy language project by LLVM. I've gotten through the lexer
but it's still mindblowing how it all works. I don't fully understand everything but the fog is certainly clearing. Especially the
way they describe how to 'tokenize' the inputs and separate it into parts that the AST and parser (I'm assuming) will understand...
whatever that's going to mean lmao.
